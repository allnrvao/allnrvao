  <summary><b>📘 About Me</b></summary>

```text
🧠 I'm Allan — curious, creative, and passionate about technology, design, and the emotions sparked by powerful ideas.

👨‍💻 I'm studying Systems Engineering, where I get to blend logic, aesthetics, and meaningful user experiences.

🎨 I love all things visual, artistic, and intuitive. I look for beauty and depth in every detail.

🎧 Music is part of my language, Music inspires me just as much as clean code or smooth animations.

🌍 I dream of building things that matter — things that speak, connect, and leave a mark.

🌱 Always learning: how to write better code, understand users more deeply, or just grow without losing what makes me, me.

🎯 My goal: to create soulful things — digital or not — that look great, work smoothly, and feel even better.
